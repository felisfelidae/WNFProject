    + addressing the problem that most connectivity models are static where landscapes are dynamic
    + Landscape connectivity is being used to combat the problems of habitat loss/fragmentation to try and understand how species are being affecting and how we can mitigate the deleterious effects; a population with some connectedness can maintain metapopulations, and increasing connectivity can be an intervention for isolated populations
    +	Google “patch colonization” and “metapopulation persistence metrics”
        +	patch colonization: when a species moves into an empty patch of land – this sub population may eventually die out, but if patch colonization continues at a replacement rate, the metapopulation will remain stable (https://www.bgu.ac.il/desert_agriculture/Popecology/PEtexts/PE-K.htm)
        +	metapopulation persistence metrics: ways to measure whether the metapopulation is stable despite patch extinctions due to patch recolonization and patch dispersal (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004251)
    +	Matrix: “the portion of the landscape that extends among identified habitat patches”
    +	Patches, corridors, and matrices are all part of a good connectivity model
    +	Gaps in landscape connectivity: factoring in dynamism due to temporal scale in terms of seasons, years, and decades
    +	increases in data availability and personal computational power have made dynamic connectivity more viable to integrate into connectivity models; the outstanding questions are “how much to put in” and “how to understand what we get out”
    +	Spatial prioritization concepts:
        +	complementarity: “identification of linkages that complement others”
            +	what does this mean?
        +	redundancy: making sure there are multiple linkages so that if one is lost, the landscape isn’t completely fucked up
        +	irreplaceability: how much redundancy there is for a landscape linkage; how much the connectivity would be impacted by removal of this particular linkage
        +	permanence: how resilient a linkage is to dynamism, how likely it is to remain stable throughout time
    +	Functional connectivity: ability of a specific species to move through a landscape
![Image from Zeller](RMDImages/SpatialvsTemporalConnectivityZeller.png)
    +	Gene flow is a general measure for long-term connectivity
    +	A problem that dynamic connectivity needs to address is that structural connectivity changes a lot more predictably than functional connectivity, which can change very rapidly or over long periods of time
        +	phenomena such as temperature, weather, or human activity may cause fluxes in functional connectivity on a scale of hours to days
    +	seasonal connectivity especially relevant for migratory species whose functional connectivity differs strongly from season to season
        +	“Landscape dynamics may be represented using seasonal land use/land cover maps, while movement data may be subset to different seasons for analysis.”
    +	two main modeling strategies for addressing climate change are:
        +	functional assessments (often with a species of interest)
            +	create connectivity models for the future based on our ideas of how species will respond to certain types of change
        +	structural approaches
            +	focused on picking out which features will support connectivity no matter what kind of climate change happens/ways to use the environment to minimize the impact of climate change
    +	Functional connectivity prediction often looks at the future in discretized time steps, which has the problem of not providing a model for the flow and change of connectivity during the intervening blocks of time, which may cause connectivity underestimation and predictions of patch isolation greater than is experienced when the flow of species through time is accounted for
    +	structural approaches often look at where there might be habitats like the ones which may be damaged or destroyed under climate change – rather than looking at what a species might do, which is very uncertain by nature, it looks more at where a species might be moved so that it can persist even under climate change
    +	modeling considerations
        +	extent of habitat-shifting events
        +	severity of above
        +	time until landscape recovery
    +	“In cases where incorporating movement or landscape dynamics into connectivity planning and management is necessary, a number of strategies may facilitate the translation of models and assessments into action. As connectivity planning and implementation are often components of landscape-scale conservation planning efforts, many of the same reserve design principles that address dynamics, accommodate change, and prioritize actions can be applied (e.g., [92,93]). For example, when the dynamics of disturbance events (e.g., wildfire, flooding) affect landscape structure or animal movement, establishing redundancy in linkages [94] can allow for alternative movement routes if conditions in a linkage become temporarily unsuitable. For long-term shifts, considering complementarity in linkages, where key features of local or regional linkages are added to a network across multiple land units or linkages, can maximize efficacy and flexibility while establishing priorities to support dynamic connectivity. However, when those shifts put linkages at risk of being degraded or lost entirely as a result of permanent change, adjusting connectivity targets may be warranted. Furthermore, it may be necessary to identify irreplaceable linkages where minimizing the impacts of landscape dynamics that can lead to the degradation of habitat quality or connectivity value becomes a long-term management target. In addition to these prioritization strategies, evaluating worst-case scenarios [90] or thresholds associated with disturbance and change responses relative to different conservation actions and management options [93] can be critical to establishing networks that are sustainable both biologically and economically.”

    +	Big Data
        +	data in excess of a person or field’s ability to analyze
        +	the “four V’s”: volume, variety, veracity, and velocity
    +	Sources of mass ecological data generation:
        +	remote sensors monitoring the earth (satellites, etc)
        +	the ability to join individual scientific work to the greater body of work
        +	long term ecological monitoring networks
        +	automated sensor networks that can be left in the field (such as cameras that take pictures when they sense movement)
        +	citizen science initiatives
    +	Because there are so many sources of data in the eco-sciences, variety and veracity are the biggest problems eco-data-scientists run into, with data collected in many different ways that may not all be of the same time and is thus hard to run meta-analyses on and difficulty of being sure that all data is accurate, given its heterogeneity
    +	ecological forecasting depends on closeness of model and data, and iterative looping, possibly self correcting, to improve and refine forecasts
    +	“Common examples in ecology include boosted regression trees, generalized linear models, and random forest models (e.g., Elith et al. 2006), but ML approaches also include more complex methods such as knowledge learning and analysis systems (Peters et al. 2014). Artificial neural networks, organized into layers of “neurons” or nodes, are the basis of “deep” ML and have become increasingly powerful as the number of nodes and layers increases.”

    +	Generally really interesting article with a lot of ways that modeling can be applied to the problems of connectivity and climate change; worth a re-read.
    +	Addressing habitat connectivity, utility of wildlife corridors to combat fragmentation, and species resilience to climate change
    +	Range shifts related to climate change will move along temperature and moisture gradients, providing a template to map connectivity 
    +	climate velocity: “the speed at which a population would have to move to keep up with the changing climate on the landscape” in °C year−1/ °C km−1 (the ratio of rate of climate change and the spatial gradient)
    +	Low climate velocity areas support greater diversity of species, especially those with small ranges. 
        +	this suggests that rugged areas may be climate resilient because they allow species to move shorter distances in order to remain in suitable habitat as climate changes
        +	on the other hand, studies of montane biomes suggest that the paths between areas that currently support species and those that might support those same species in the climate-altered future cross over terrain which is extremely different and may be functionally impassible
        +	so for now it’s a wash?
    +	Genetic refuge theory apparently has some basis in paleoecology? Which is cool – the Pleistocene era suffered a warming event and we can do some movement tracing to see how species responded to that
    +	Macrorefugia vs microrefugia – basically large swaths of land on which a species can survive versus climactic pockets in an otherwise inhospitable climate in which species can survive in pocket communities; the latter is important to look at through the lense of connectivity
        +	microrefugia of the future, however, can only be identified by extremely granular climate data, to the point that they may require field sampling to be able to be picked out
    +	Types of microrefugia:
        +	stepping stones; facilitators of movement of a species, factored into climate corridor planning theory
        +	microclimate refugia; pockets with lower rate of climate change than their surroundings, decrease species’ climate velocity
        +	in-situ refugia; sites which will continue to be suitable for a species (for a time, at least) as the climate changes for a number of weather/temperature/location reasons
        +	ex-situ refugia; currently unsuitable sites which will become suitable as the climate changes
        +	and some other smaller less known ones (drought refugia, evolutionary refugia, hydrologic refugia, genetic refugia)
    +	refugia aren’t about permanence but about slowing climate velocity enough to prevent extinction: they’re a time-buying measure that we need to plan for
    +	trailing edges: location that will have reduced suitability under climate change
        +	expected to be found at more southerly (closer to the equator?) or lowland locations
    +	leading edges: location that may experience increased suitability for some species/populations under climate change
        +	expected to be found northerly (polar?), high elevation, and coastal locations
    +	trailing and leading edges can also be found in smaller locations: the paper uses the example of a south-facing slope as a trailing edge or a sheltered valley as a leading edge
    +	one of the goals of conservationists is to create connectivity between trailing edges, currently suitable habitat, leading edges, and future habitat to allow for species range shifts
    +	climate analogs: ‘locations with similar climates across current conditions and future scenarios’
        +	climate analogs or predicted climate analogs are end goals for connectivity corridor planners
    +	what is “climat*”???
    +	There’s a “Table 1.” which displays the “advantages and disadvantages of strategies to improve climate-wise connectivity”, good to look at later?
    +	“A simulation study examining the effectiveness of different conservation strategies to promote range expansion in a real landscape on eight modeled species with a range of life history strategies found that increasing the amount of habitat throughout the landscape is one of the most effective strategies to facilitate movement (Synes et al 2015)”
        +	this seems like a fun parameter to work on in SSim/Circuitscape
    +	conserving or restoring connectivity is particularly important for plants, as habitat fragmentation may totally prevent range shifts of even plants particularly good at moving across distances
    +	because connectivity corridors can be expensive, creating small microrefugia not too far apart is another strategy which can be balanced for best cost/effectiveness
    
    ![Image from Keeley](RMDImages/ConnectivityImportantLandsKeeley.png)
    +	riparian areas super important!!
    +	land facet corridors: identifies and seeks to preserve continuous topography and soil type 
    +	Streams facilitate connectivity naturally so they make good targets for conservation acquisition
    +	“Alternatively, climate-wise corridors can be incorporated into systematic conservation plans by specifying surrogates for key ecological and evolutionary processes such as upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients as conservation targets (Cowling et al 2003). To capture these gradients in regional-scale corridors, Rouget et al (2006) combined least-cost path analysis with a systematic conservation planning approach that targeted ecosystem representation, suitable wildlife areas, irreplaceable vegetation types, and considered current and future land-use patterns.”
    +	Problems with spatial modeling for considering the future under climate change:
        +	uncertainties in data/model parameters, like projections of future carbon emissions
        +	lack of breadth to encompass every factor in an ecological web. The paper uses the example of a plant dispersal model under climate change that doesn’t factor in seasonal changes in soil qualities
        +	impossibility of determining what “novel climates” may be created under climate change
    +	“Table 2. Advantages and disadvantages of climate-wise connectivity modeling approaches.” also a great reference point
    +	One current potentially problematic assumption made by climate connectivity modelers is that species’ current behavior is in a climate equilibrium; another is that species will not be able to evolve to tolerate a new climate (at least not on the time scale we’re facing down)
    +	We also assume that species will move into new suitable habitat as long as it is available, without any significant damage to their populations
    +	Structural connectivity models which assume all human use is equally bad for species movements may miss opportunities to protect human-impacted lands that will nonetheless provide migration pathways with some level of human intervention
    +	“If protected areas need to be connected for entire ecosystems to thrive and adapt, we suggest starting with structural connectivity designs to capture the connectivity needs of the majority of species. In regions with high topographic diversity, land facet corridors (Brost and Beier 2012a), and environmental gradients (Nuñez et al 2013) are two good options. While the land facet corridor approach usually yields several corridor strands between protected areas harboring suitable habitat for the species adapted to the designated land facet, environmental gradient corridors generally result in one optimally stable climate corridor. In regions with low topographic diversity, microclimatically diverse corridors that, if possible, connect protected areas with an altitudinal or latitudinal differential should be prioritized (Anderson et al 2016). If climate mitigation through retention of above ground carbon and future sequestration is the primary objective, then carbon-stock corridors can be modeled (Jantz et al 2014).”
    +	Description of a modeling technique:
        +	“When modeling climate-wise corridors between protected areas, refugia can be integrated into the corridor models by mapping the rate of climate change to identify in-situ refugia. Coristine et al (2016) determined the climate vulnerability by assessing the change and variability of several climate variables relevant to pollinator species over the past decades. Grid cells with lower rates and reduced climatic variability (refugia) were assigned lower resistance values than cells with higher rates and increased variability of climate change to favor the conservation of corridors with refugial value.”
    +	Lower resistance rates for lower climate change cells in connectivity modeling
    +	POSSIBLE RESOURCE -> conservationcorridor.org
    +	Conefor, graphhab, IGRAPH, all do conservation modeling via graph theory, worth looking into
    +	LARCH for metapopulation analyses

    +	There was a great deal I didn’t understand about this paper, which is fine, because there were also large chunks which I did understand.
    +	In essence, McRae is modeling patch connectivity using undirected weighted graphs using the model of circuits and resistors, patches are graph vertexes, or nodes, and connectivity is modeled along the weighted edges, which are modeled with resistors.
    +	The physics circuit part is a little bit of a wash, but he uses Laplacian matrices to represent the undirected graphs and then calculate resistance distance by a bit of very simple matrix algebra – worth looking into
    +	IBR – resistance distance
    +	LPC – least cost distance
    +	IBD – Euclidian distance
    +	Markov chains showed up again, this time saying that IBR was able to outperform them in modeling connectivity; worth noting and paying special attention in ML to see if I can integrate python into this in some way
        +	the markov chain algorithm was also used to calculate IBR? So…I am not sure about that

    +	McRae’s work based in random walk theory – look into that
    +	“Table 1. Electrical terms and their ecological interpretations” a good reference point
    +	Making circuit theory work for raster grids:
        +	grid cells with finite resistance become nodes
        +	grid cells with infinite resistance (barriers) are dropped
        +	adjacent nodes are connected by a resistor, the resistance value of which is calculated by the resistance values of its nodes
            +	QUESTION: how are these resistance values initially obtained?
        +	adjacent zero-resistance cells are clustered into a single node, which is then connected to neighboring nodes by resistance pathways
        +	Java, C, and python all have “linear solver routines” which can solve for the effective resistances in our generated graphs
            +	this can be done so efficiently. how????
    +	Habitat cul de sacs?
    +	Look into edge and node thinning
    +	One area which may or may not have research done in it yet is model parameterization for circuit theory: examples include mortality probability, settlement probability
        +	“practitioners should also consider approaches taken to parameterize other models that consider habitat heterogeneity, such as diffusion and simulation models (e.g., Dunning et al.1995, Schumaker 1996, Ovaskainen 2004; Arellano etal.,in press; Ovaskainen et al.,in press).”
    +	limits:
        +	circuit graphs can only be undirected – in directed environments (anything with a water current, notably) this poses a problem
        +	circuit graph walks can only be random, which means they aren’t robust to things like aging to learned behaviors, as the simulated walkers cannot recall what has previously “worked”
            +	relatedly, circuit walkers may inflate mortality rates by continuing to walk into mortality traps since they don’t do things like rest or avoid a previous danger
    +	markov chain models mentioned again: markov chains can be directionalized

Briske, 303–45. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46709-2_9.
    +	The foundation of an STM is to describe types of vegetation communities, so that clear succession classes and different site communities can be established and differentiated from each other. Then the sites are differentiated, to parse out the different communities which can occur at one site from a different community at a totally separate site. Finally, the types and causes of transitions between communities at a single site are identified, though there is always a measure of uncertainty with this step.
    +	STMs combine diagrams and narratives to explain a site, with the quantitative information about probabilistic transitions coming in later
    +	State transitions are a more modern version of the old idea of orderly succession, where there’s a disturbance and then the plant community goes through a linear series of transitions to a climax community; rather, the notion is that multiple plant communities can arise from a disturbance, that disturbances may not be reversible, and that communities can suddenly change without following any kind of continual progression
    +	Transient dynamics: caused by disturbance or weather, produce significant disruption but are able to revert on the scale of years to decades
    +	State transitions: persistent disruptions to the vegetative community such that a return to the previous state would take incredibly long, require active restoration, or perhaps would need a full reversal of climate change
    +	Sometimes seasonal or weather patterns can cause a change in what species dominate a community without representing a stable change, as another change in weather/season or a related likely factor can shift the representation in the community back
    +	State transitions are understood by: persistence of new plant communities, or a range of plant variation among the community which is stable and different than the previous state
    +	A low resilience community is susceptible to a state transition
    +	If grasslands don’t burn, woody plants begin to dominate, and if the woody plants are allowed to choke out enough grass or to get so large they don’t burn effectively, burns become ineffective at restoring the grassland
    +	Desertification can be caused by habitat fragmentation for plants
    +	 During a state transition, feedback can amplify the transition and cause the new state to persist
    +	Defining states and state transitions empirically has been difficult for STM users and developers, as quantitative data on plant communities is hard to come by

            +	Takes the same inputs as pairwise and one-to-all, but gives one node the ground, gives current to all the others, and then iterates through all of the nodes
        +	Focal regions/focal points and short circuit regions both have resistances of 0, but short circuit regions, which are optional, neither ground nor produce current
            +	If cells have the same region ID, they are considered the same node whether or not they are actually contiguous

  + samc is a spatial modeling framework in R in which mortality is represented as a transition to an absorbing state of a Markov chain, where movements are represented by transient states
  + work was done on Puma concolor, making these results ideal for comparison to the work done in Circuitscape on Puma concolor for results of different connectivity modeling approaches
  + purpose of samc is to distinguish between movement (organisms experiencing resistance at a landscape feature because they cannot cross it) and mortality (organisms experiencing resistance at a landscape feature because it kills them) to provide more nuanced understanding of what a connectivity model actually represents
      + the ideal for this work is that, in distinguishing sites of high mortality rather than simply impediment to movement, areas which can be addressed
